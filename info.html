            The Maria Wildfire occured minutes after the Southern California Edison electric company restarted its 16,000-volt lines. It is believed to have been caused by a spark from the wires' restart and many towns turned to power shutdowns to prevent the fire from spreading. After causing 7,500 people evacuate the area, about 9,000 acres of land was demolished by the fire. One of the offiicers headiing the  Maria Fire said that a photographer flying a drone caused an emergency plan carrying estinguishers to do an emergency landing. Authorities say the offical cause of this fire is unclear, but that it started near instrastructures that may have been involved in the creatiion of the Maria Fire.
